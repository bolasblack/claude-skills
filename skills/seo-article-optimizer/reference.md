# SEO Article Optimizer — Reference

## A) Title & Lead Structure (By Intent)

### Informational
- Definition + audience pain point + 3 sub-problems you'll solve
- Example: "What is X? Learn how to solve [pain point] with our step-by-step guide covering [topic 1], [topic 2], and [topic 3]."

### Commercial
- Comparison dimensions + scenario + recommendation logic
- Example: "X vs Y: Which is better for [use case]? We compare features, pricing, and performance to help you decide."

### Transactional
- Clear "who it's for / not for" + key specs/pricing/steps
- Example: "Get started with X in 5 minutes. Perfect for [target audience], this guide walks you through setup, pricing ($X/mo), and first steps."

## B) Internal Linking Strategy

Each article should have at least:
- **1 early link**: Within first 20% of content, pointing to key conversion page
- **1 mid-content link**: Pointing to features/case studies/documentation
- **1 CTA link in conclusion**: Pointing to signup/trial/contact

### Anchor Text Best Practices
- Use descriptive, keyword-rich anchors
- Avoid generic "click here" or "read more"
- Vary anchor text for the same target URL across articles
- Match user intent (informational anchors for blog posts, action-oriented for product pages)

## C) Trust Signals (E-E-A-T)

### Experience
- First-hand experience with the topic
- Personal anecdotes or case studies
- Screenshots, demos, or original research

### Expertise
- Author bio with relevant credentials
- Technical depth appropriate to the topic
- Accurate, up-to-date information

### Authoritativeness
- Citations to authoritative sources
- Links from other reputable sites (earned over time)
- Recognition in the field

### Trustworthiness
- Clear author attribution
- Transparent about affiliations/sponsorships
- Updated dates for time-sensitive content
- Contact information and about page

## D) Readability Metrics for Non-English Content

Flesch Reading Ease doesn't apply perfectly to non-English content. Use these alternative metrics:

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Avg sentence length | < 35 chars (CJK) / < 20 words (EN) | Long sentences reduce comprehension |
| Paragraph length | < 120 chars (CJK) / < 150 words (EN) | Aids scanning |
| Technical term density | Moderate | Add explanations/examples/analogies when high |
| Transition word usage | Adequate | "However", "Therefore", "Additionally" help logical flow |

### Rewrite Example

**Before (too long):**
> In today's rapidly evolving digital transformation landscape, businesses need to continuously update and upgrade their technology infrastructure to ensure they can maintain a leading position in fierce market competition while meeting the ever-increasing expectations and demands of customers.

**After (clearer):**
> Digital transformation requires continuous tech infrastructure updates. This helps businesses stay competitive and meet growing customer expectations.
